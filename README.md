<h1> Implement a design from scratch </h1>
<p> Hello! Thanks for diving in this far! 
<br> In this project, I will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that I have learned previously. </p>

<h3> What's Stored in here ? </h3>
<p> I wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, however I am free to implement it the way that I want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file. </p>
